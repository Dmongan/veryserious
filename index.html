      <p>Welcome to the corporate page for Very Serious, LLC, the maker of Headway Journal, the best way to start and end your day (on your phone). The company is a loose collective of freelancers and agnecies run by one Very Serious Dude, Dave Mongan, who has a passion for self-improvement and helping others. He started this company because he figured it was the best way to meld his interests into something that, with your help, may very well be economically viable.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      The company is called Very Serious, LLC because it's a serious-sounding name that instills confidence. This is important because you're trusting us with your data and, should anyone ever accuse us of not taking things seriously, we can just point to the name on the proverbial door. Most companies try to communicate how serious and responsible they are through a clever-sounding name they spent hours thinking up. Indeed, we considered many other names to accomplish this—Monolithico Inc., Igneous Enterprises, Dave's App Shack—but ultimately we decided to come right out and say it. We figure you're smart enough to see through that kind of nonsense, anyways. Plus, we have a strict no-pandering policy.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Our Corporate Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your data is your business - We keep it safe, don't look at it or give/sell it to anyone else.</li>
        <li>Simple and effective is better than complex and cool</li>
        <li>Simple, effective and fun is best</li>
        <li>No pandering</li>
        <li>And some other stuff we won't bore you with</li>
      </ul>
